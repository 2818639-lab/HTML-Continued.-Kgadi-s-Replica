    <p>In today's world, <b>knowledge</b> can often feel like a heavy weight, revealing truths that are uncomfortable and sometimes overwhelming. You discover that the more they know, the more you realise how little control you truly have, making awareness almost <i>exhausting</i>. Meanwhile, others live in a state of <b><i>ignorance</i></b>, untouched by the stress of global issues, digital overload, and constant information. In a strange way, this creates a contrast where <b>knowledge</b> becomes a burden while <i>ignorance</i> appears blissful, offering a simple escape from the chaos of modern life like this dog below.</p>
